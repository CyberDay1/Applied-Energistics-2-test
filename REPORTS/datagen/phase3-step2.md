# Phase 3 Datagen Run â€“ Step 2

## Summary
- Attempted to execute `./gradlew --console=plain runData` with the NeoForge 1.21.4 Stonecutter target.
- Gradle wrapper upgraded to 8.13 to satisfy `net.neoforged.gradle.userdev` plugin requirements.
- Build progressed through NeoForm setup but failed during `:1.21.4:compileJava` because the trimmed test sources omit
  several 1.21.x API classes (e.g. `net.minecraft.world.ItemInteractionResult`, `InteractionResultHolder`).
- Generated resource updates were authored manually to match the new datagen providers while the compilation issue remains.

## Follow-up
- Restore compatibility shims or adjust the userdev dependency to a snapshot that exposes the 1.21.x API used by the test sources.
- Re-run `./gradlew runData` once the missing classes compile to validate automated output parity.
